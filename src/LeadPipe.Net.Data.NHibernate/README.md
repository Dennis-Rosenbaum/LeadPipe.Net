# LeadPipe.Net.Data.NHibernate

LeadPipe.Net.Data.NHibernate is a comprehensive pre-built data implementation package that uses NHibernate and provides implementations of a Repository, the Query Object pattern, and Unit of Work pattern. This library is built in such a way that if you don't want to abstract NHibernate's ISession object with a Unit of Work or use the Repository pattern, you can still take advantage of other offerings such as the Query Object pattern and Object Finder.
